# Java-Final-Exam
This was my final exam for my Java in Processing class.
It includes code designed to be as compact as possible to create 3 projects: 
-a gradient of circles                                                                                                  
-a fahrenheit to celcius converter                                                                                    
-a randomized dice game between two characters
